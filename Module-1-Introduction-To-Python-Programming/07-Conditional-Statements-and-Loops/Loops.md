## Section 1: Introduction to Loops

##### 1.1 What are Loops?

**Loops in Python**

Programming relies heavily on loops, which enable us to execute a set of instructions repeatedly. With their help, we can automate repetitive tasks, iterate through data collections, and solve complex problems more efficiently. In Python, there are two main types of loops: the "for" loop and the "while" loop.

---

## Section 2: The `for` Loop

**The `for` Loop**

We use the `for` loop when we know the number of iterations in advance or want to iterate over sequence elements like a list or a string. It follows a specific syntax:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # code to be executed
```

In this scenario, the term `item` stands for a variable that will adopt the value of each element in the sequence. Meanwhile, `sequence` indicates the collection of elements to be iterated over. The code within the loop's block will be executed for each iteration.

**üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª You Do**

1. Create a list called `airplanes` with the following planes: "Boeing", "Airbus", "Embraer", "Bombardier", and "ATR".
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the list and print each element.

```python
# Your code here

```


##### 2.1 Using the `range()` Function

**The `range()` Function**

The `range()` function allows us to generate a sequence of numbers based on the specified start, stop, and step values. It follows the syntax:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

The `start` argument defines the starting value (inclusive), the `stop` argument defines the ending value (exclusive), and the `step` argument defines the increment or decrement between numbers. By default, the `start` value is 0, and the `step` value is 1.

Let's explore some examples of using the `range()` function:

```python
for number in range(5):
    print(number)
```

This code will print the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

```python
for number in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(number)
```

In this example, the loop will iterate over the odd numbers from 1 to 9: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

**üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª You Do**

1. Use the `range()` function to print the numbers 1 to 10.
2. Use the `range()` function to print the numbers 10 to 1.

```python
# Your code here
```

###### 2.2 Iterating with `for` Loops

**Iterating Over Elements**

A common way to use the `for` loop is to go through a sequence like a list, string, or tuple. For instance, here's an example of printing every item in a list: 

```python
dog_breeds = ["Labrador", "Poodle", "Husky", "Beagle", "Bulldog"]
for breed in dog_breeds:
    print(breed)
```

In this example, the `dog_breeds` list is iterated over, and the `print()` function is called for each iteration, displaying the corresponding breed.


```python
for letter in "Python":
    print(letter)
```
**üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª You Do**

1. Create a list called `numbers` with the following numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the list and print each element.

```python
# Your code here
```


**Iterating with `for` and `range()`**

The `range()` function is often used in conjunction with the `for` loop to specify a range of numbers to iterate over. The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from a starting value to an ending value (exclusive).

```python
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(number)
```

In this example, the loop will iterate over the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, printing each number on a separate line.

**üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª You Do**

1. Use the `range()` function with a `for` loop to print the word "Python" from the string `"Python'sAwesome"`.

```python
# Your code here

```

## Section 3: The `while` Loop

##### 3.1 What is the `while` Loop?

**The `while` Loop**

The `while` loop is utilized to execute a set of instructions repeatedly until a specific condition is no longer true. It has a distinct syntax from the `for` loop. See example below:

```python
while condition:
    # code to be executed
```

The loop will continue running as long as the `condition` is true. Once the condition becomes false, the loop will stop, and the program will move on to the next line of code.

##### 3.2 Executing with `while` Loops

**Using a Condition**

A  `while` loop will keep running as long as the given condition is true. The condition is checked before every iteration. For instance, to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop, we can use the following example code in Python: 

```python
number = 1

while number <= 5:
    print(number)
    number += 1
```

In this code, the loop will execute as long as `number` is less than or equal to 5. After each iteration, the value of `number` is incremented by 1 using the `+=` operator.

**üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª You Do**

1. Create a `while` loop that prints the string `"Python's Awesome"` 5 times.

```python
# Your code here

```

##### 3.3 Loop Control Statements

**The `break` Statement**

The `break` statement in Python exits a loop before it completes all iterations. This statement allows us to terminate the loop based on a specific condition, even if the loop's condition is still true. To better understand this concept, let's examine an example:

```python
number = 1

while number <= 10:
    if number == 5:
        break
    print(number)
    number += 1
```

In this code, the loop will terminate when `number` becomes 5. The `break` statement is encountered, causing the loop to exit immediately.

Use the `break` statement to exit the loop when `number` is equal to 5.

```python
# Your code here

while number <= 10:
    if number == 5:
        break
    print(number)
    number += 1
```

**The `continue` Statement**

The  `continue` statement enables the skipping of remaining code in the current iteration and proceeding to the next iteration. It is useful for bypassing certain iterations based on specific conditions. Here is an example:

```python
number = 1

while number <= 5:
    if number == 3:
        number += 1
        continue
    print(number)
    number += 1
```

In this code, when `number` is equal to 3, the `continue` statement is encountered, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration without executing the remaining code within the loop block. Therefore, the number

 3 will not be printed.


**üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª You Do**

**Use the continue and break statements**

1. Print the numbers 1 to 100, skipping odd numbers. Use continue to skip odd numbers.
2. Use the break statement to exit the loop when the number is 50.

```python
# Your code here

```

---

## Section 4: Practical Examples

##### 4.1 Example 1: Printing Numbers

Let's consider an example of using a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10:

```python
for number in range(1, 11):
    print(number)
```

This code will display the numbers 1 to 10, each on a separate line.

##### 4.2 Example 2: Sum of Digits

Here's an example of using a loop to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number:

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum_of_digits = 0

while number > 0:
    digit = number % 10
    sum_of_digits += digit
    number //= 10

print("The sum of digits is:", sum_of_digits)
```

In this code, the user is prompted to enter a number. The loop calculates the sum of the digits by continuously extracting the last digit (`digit`) using the modulus operator `%`, adding it to the `sum_of_digits`, and then dividing the number by 10 (`number //= 10`) to remove the last digit. The loop continues until the number becomes 0.

##### 4.3 Example 3: Finding Prime Numbers

Let's see an example of using a loop to find all prime numbers within a given range:

```python
start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
end = int(input("Enter the ending number: "))

print("Prime numbers between", start, "and", end, "are:")

for number in range(start, end + 1):
    if number > 1:
        for divisor in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
            if number % divisor == 0:
                break
        else:
            print(number)
```

Here, the user inputs the range of numbers they want to check for prime numbers. The code then iterates through each number in the range and determines if it is prime. A number is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 and itself. The code checks for divisibility using a loop from 2 to the square root of the number. If a divisor is found, the "break" statement exits the loop. If no divisor is found, the code executes the "else" block and prints the prime number.

We can automate repetitive tasks, iterate over collections, and solve complex problems more efficiently with loops. By mastering the `for` and `while` loops and loop control statements like `break` and `continue`, you'll have a robust set of tools to tackle a wide range of programming challenges.
