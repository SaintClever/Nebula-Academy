# Topic 2: Mastering Python Scripts and Notebooks in Visual Studio Code

## Introduction

With Visual Studio Code (VS Code) already installed, it's time to dive deeper into its capabilities for Python development. This lecture combines configuring VS Code for Python notebooks with the nuances of working with Python scripts. We'll explore how these two formats complement each other and how to effectively utilize them in VS Code.

## Python Notebooks in VS Code

Python notebooks, or `.ipynb` files, offer an interactive environment blending executable Python code with rich text and visuals, ideal for data analysis, scientific research, and education.

### Setting Up for Python Notebooks

- **Creating a New Notebook**: Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and type `Create: New Jupyter Notebook`, or create a new file with the `.ipynb` extension.
- **Interactive Experience**: Add code or Markdown text cells. Execute code cells using `Run` or `Shift+Enter`.
- **Dependencies**: If Python or Jupyter isn't installed, the Python extension in VS Code will prompt you for installation.

## Python Scripts in VS Code

Python scripts are `.py` files that contain Python code. They are fundamental for application development, automation, and large projects.

### Running Python Scripts

1. **Open or Create a Script**: Open an existing `.py` file or save a new one with the `.py` extension.
2. **Running the Script**: Use the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+` or `Cmd+`) to navigate to the script's directory and execute it by typing `python filename.py`.

### Efficient Script Execution

- **Code Linting**: Extensions like 'Python' or 'Pylint' help identify potential errors.
- **Debugging**: Utilize VS Code's debugger for a thorough code analysis.
- **Virtual Environments**: Manage dependencies specific to your project without affecting global installations.

## Combining Scripts and Notebooks

Understanding when to use scripts versus notebooks is critical. Scripts are great for complete applications and tasks, while notebooks are ideal for experimentation and data analysis. Switching between these two formats effectively will significantly enhance your Python programming skills.

## Additional Tools and Extensions

- **Code Completions**: Extensions like 'Python AutoComplete' or 'IntelliCode' provide AI-assisted completions.
- **Kite**: An AI-powered assistant offering code completions (free version available).
- **GitHub Copilot**: A paid tool for advanced AI-driven code completions.

## Conclusion

Mastering Python scripts and notebooks in VS Code is a crucial skill for any Python developer. Whether developing complex applications or conducting sophisticated data analyses, these tools and techniques will significantly boost your productivity and coding effectiveness.
