### Python Versions

#### üêç Python: A Brief History
The roots of Python trace back to the late 1980s, thanks to Guido van Rossum, a visionary Dutch computer programmer. Python was born out of his desire for a language that embodied simplicity and accessibility, yet was robust enough for complex computations.

You might be surprised to learn that Python was not named after the large snake species, but after Monty Python's Flying Circus, a British comedy sketch series beloved by van Rossum. In honor of this whimsical origin, here's an image encapsulating this fun fact:

#### Evolution of Python Versions
Since its inception, Python has undergone several significant updates that introduced new features and enhancements. Python 2.0, released in 2000, brought revolutionary changes such as list comprehension, garbage collection, and Unicode support. In 2008, Python 3.0 was launched, heralding extensive modifications like improved Unicode functionality, a new I/O library, and various syntax tweaks.

Python 2 reached its end-of-life status in 2020. Today, Python 3 is the standard, meeting the evolving needs of developers with continuous updates and improvements.
