### Question 1: Sum of Positive Numbers
Write a Python program using a `while` loop that asks the user to enter numbers repeatedly. The loop should accumulate the sum of positive numbers entered and stop when the user enters a negative number. At the end, print out the sum of all positive numbers entered.

### Question 2: Find the Largest Number
Using a `for` loop, write a program that iterates through a list of numbers (you can define the list with some sample numbers) and finds the largest number in the list. Print the largest number at the end.

### Question 3: Password Attempt
Create a program with a `while` loop that simulates a password entry system. Define a password string at the start of your program. Then, repeatedly ask the user to enter the password. If the user enters the correct password, print a success message and break out of the loop. If the user enters the wrong password, allow them to try again.

### Question 4: Skip Multiples of Three
Write a program using a `for` loop and the `continue` statement that iterates through numbers 1 to 30 (inclusive). Use the `continue` statement to skip any number that is a multiple of 3. Print out all numbers that are not multiples of 3.

### Question 5: Multiplication Table
Using nested loops, write a program that prints out the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 5. The outer loop should iterate through the multiplier, and the inner loop should iterate through the multiplicand. Format the output so that it's easy to read the multiplication table.
