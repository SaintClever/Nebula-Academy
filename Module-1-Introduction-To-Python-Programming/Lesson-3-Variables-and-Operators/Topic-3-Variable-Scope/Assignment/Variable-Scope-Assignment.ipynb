    "## Introduction to Global and Local Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment explores the concepts of global and local variables in Python. You'll learn how the scope of a variable affects where it can be used in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Global Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Global variables are accessible throughout your entire script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 1.1:** Create a variable `global_var` at the start of your script and assign it the value `10`. Then, further down in your script, change the value of `global_var` to `20`. After each assignment, use `print()` to display the value of `global_var`. Observe how its value changes and remains accessible throughout the script.\n"

    "- **Challenge 2:** Create a global variable `count` and set it to `10`. Then, inside an `if` block, define a local variable `count` and set it to `5`. Print `count` inside the block and again outside of it. Observe how the scope of `count` changes its value.\n"
