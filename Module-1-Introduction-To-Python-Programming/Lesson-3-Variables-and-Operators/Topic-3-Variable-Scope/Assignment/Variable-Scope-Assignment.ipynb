    "## Exercise 1: Global Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Global variables are accessible throughout your entire script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 1.1:** Create a variable `global_var` at the start of your script and assign it the value `10`. Then, further down in your script, change the value of `global_var` to `20`. After each assignment, use `print()` to display the value of `global_var`. Observe how its value changes and remains accessible throughout the script.\n"
