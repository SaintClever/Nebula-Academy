# 1. **Arithmetic Operations**
#    - Add `25` and `75` and print the result.
#    - Multiply `7` by `6` and display the outcome.

# 2. **Boolean Expressions**
#    - Check if `15` is greater than `10` and print the result.
#    - Compare if `20` is equal to `20` and output the Boolean value.

# 3. **Logical Operations**
#    - Use a logical `and` to determine if `10` is greater than `5` and `15` is less than `20`. Print the result.
#    - Apply `not` to invert the result of `5 == 5`.
