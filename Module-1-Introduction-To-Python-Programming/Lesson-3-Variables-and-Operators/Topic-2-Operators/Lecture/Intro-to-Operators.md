# Employing Operators in Python

## Arithmetic Operators
These operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

- Addition (`+`): `5 + 3` equals `8`.
- Subtraction (`-`): `5 - 3` equals `2`.
- Multiplication (`*`): `5 * 3` equals `15`.
- Division (`/`): `5 / 2` equals `2.5`.

## Boolean and Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

- Equal (`==`): Returns `True` if both sides are equal.
- Not equal (`!=`): Returns `True` if both sides are unequal.
- Greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), less than or equal to (`<=`).

Boolean values are either `True` or `False`. For example, `10 > 5` is `True`.

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

- `and`: Returns `True` if both statements are true.
- `or`: Returns `True` if one of the statements is true.


- `not`: Reverses the result, returns `False` if the result is true.
