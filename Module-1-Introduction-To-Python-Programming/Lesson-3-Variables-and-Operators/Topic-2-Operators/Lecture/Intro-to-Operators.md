# Employing Operators in Python

## Arithmetic Operators
These operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

- Addition (`+`): `5 + 3` equals `8`.
- Subtraction (`-`): `5 - 3` equals `2`.
- Multiplication (`*`): `5 * 3` equals `15`.
- Division (`/`): `5 / 2` equals `2.5`.

## Boolean and Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

- Equal (`==`): Returns `True` if both sides are equal.
- Not equal (`!=`): Returns `True` if both sides are unequal.
- Greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), less than or equal to (`<=`).

Boolean values are either `True` or `False`. For example, `10 > 5` is `True`.

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

- `and`: Returns `True` if both statements are true.
- `or`: Returns `True` if one of the statements is true.


- `not`: Reverses the result, returns `False` if the result is true.

## Practice Exercises
1. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Add `25` and `75` and print the result.
   - Multiply `7` by `6` and display the outcome.

2. **Boolean Expressions**
   - Check if `15` is greater than `10` and print the result.
   - Compare if `20` is equal to `20` and output the Boolean value.

3. **Logical Operations**
   - Use a logical `and` to determine if `10` is greater than `5` and `15` is less than `20`. Print the result.
   - Apply `not` to invert the result of `5 == 5`.

## Homework
Write a Python script that:
- Calculates and prints the result of `(50 - 5*6) / 4`.
- Checks if `100` is not equal to `90` and prints the result.
- Uses `and`, `or`, and `not` to evaluate `((5 > 3) and (10 < 12)) or not(15 < 20)` and prints the outcome.
