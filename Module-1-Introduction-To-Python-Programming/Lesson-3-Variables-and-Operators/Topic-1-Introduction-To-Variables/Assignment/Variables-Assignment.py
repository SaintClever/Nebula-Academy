# Practice Exercises
# 1. **Create and Print Variables**
#    - Create a variable named `my_name` and assign your name to it. Then print it.
#    - Now, create a variable `my_age` and assign your age. Print this, too.


# 2. **Variable Reassignment**
#    - Start with `x = 10` and then reassign `x` to a string value, say `"Python"`. Print `x` after each assignment.

# 3. **Swapping Variables**
#    - Create two variables `a` and `b` and assign values `3` and `7` to them, respectively. Print both variables.
#    - Swap the values of `a` and `b` and print them. The value of `a` should be `7` and that of `b` should be `3`.

# 4. **Variable Names**
#    - Create a variable named `1st_number` and assign a value to it. Print the variable.
