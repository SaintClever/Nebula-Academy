### 1. Simple Text Editor
Create a Python script that acts as a simple text editor. The script should allow the user to create a new text file, write content to it, and save it. It should also allow reading and displaying the content of an existing text file.

```python
# Hint: Use input() to get the filename and operation (e.g., read or write) from the user.
# Use 'open()' with 'w' or 'r' mode accordingly.
```

### 2. Log File Summary
Write a Python program to read a log file (assume it's a text file with each entry on a new line) and print a summary showing how many lines are in the file.

```python
# Hint: Open the log file in read mode, use a loop to count the lines, and then print the count.
```

### 3. Update a Text File
Create a script that updates a specific line in a text file. The user should specify the line number they want to update and the new text for that line.

```python
# Hint: Read the file's content into a list, update the specific line, then write the list back to the file.
```

### 4. List and Count Words in a Directory
Develop a Python script that lists all the `.txt` files in a given directory and counts the total number of words across all these text files.

```python
# Hint: Use 'os.listdir()' to find `.txt` files, then open each file, read its contents, and count the words.
```
