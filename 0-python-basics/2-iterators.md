# Iterators

A common task in programming is to do something X number of times.

Here lets say we are assigned to print hello world 5 times
```python
print('Hello World!')
print('Hello World!')
print('Hello World!')
print('Hello World!')
print('Hello World!')
```

This code technically does what i asked for, but if the requirements for the problem change I will manually need to change each instance.

This is where loops come into play

```python
for x in range(5):
    print('Hello World!')
```
