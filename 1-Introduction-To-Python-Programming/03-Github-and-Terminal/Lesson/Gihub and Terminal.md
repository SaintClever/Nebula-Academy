### 1. Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore two indispensable tools in programming and software development: GitHub and the Terminal. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control — essential for collaboration on team projects — while the Terminal is a powerful interface for navigating your computer and executing commands.

### 2. GitHub: Getting Started

#### 2.1 Signing Up

To start using GitHub, you first need to sign up for an account. Follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
2.  Click on the "Sign up" button on the top right corner of the page.
3.  Fill in your chosen username, email address, and password. Then click "Create account".
4.  Verify your email address by clicking on the link sent to your email.
5.  Once your account is set up, log in to access the GitHub dashboard.

#### 2.2 Creating a Repository

After setting up your account, let's create your first repository:

1.  Click on the '+' icon at the top right corner of the GitHub dashboard, then select "New repository".
2.  Name your repository and provide a short description.
3.  Choose whether you want your repository to be public or private.
4.  Check the box for "Initialize this repository with a README" – this is a good practice as it explains what your project is about.
5.  Click "Create repository" to finish the process.

### 3. Terminal: Basics and Navigation

#### 3.1 Accessing the Terminal

The process to access the Terminal depends on your operating system. For Windows, you can use PowerShell or Command Prompt; for macOS and Linux, you can use Terminal.

#### 3.2 Basic Commands

Here are some basic commands you can try in your terminal:

1.  `pwd`: This command prints the name of the current directory.
2.  `ls`: This command lists all files and directories in the current directory.
3.  `cd`: This command changes the current directory. You can use `cd ..` to go up one level, or `cd [directory name]` to go into a specific directory.
4.  `mkdir`: This command creates a new directory. To use it, type `mkdir [directory name]`.
5.  `touch`: This command creates a new file. To use it, type `touch [file name]`.

### 4. Practical Applications and Key Concepts

#### 4.1 Understanding Paths

Understanding file paths is crucial to navigate directories effectively. There are two types of paths: absolute and relative. An absolute path starts from the root directory and specifies the exact location of a file or directory. A relative path, on the other hand, starts from the current directory.

#### 4.2 Identifying and Viewing Hidden Files

By default, the Terminal doesn't show hidden files. These files usually start with a dot (`.`), for example, `.gitignore`. To view hidden files, use `ls -a`.

By the end of this lesson, you should feel comfortable navigating GitHub and the Terminal, and understand their crucial role in programming and software development.
