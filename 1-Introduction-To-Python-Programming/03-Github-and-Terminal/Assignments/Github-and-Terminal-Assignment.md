## Your First Python Project on GitHub

**Objective**
In this assignment, we're going to use Git and GitHub to start a Python project repository. You'll recreate a specific file structure, make modifications using commits, and then push those updates back to GitHub. 

**Instructions**
Follow the steps below to complete this assignment:

1. **New Repository:** In GitHub, create a new repository called "python-notes".

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the new repository to your local system using the `git clone` command.

3. **Create File Structure:** Use the structure below as a guide to create your file structure:

```
python-notes/
├── 1-Introduction-To-Python-Programming
│   ├── 03-Github-and-Terminal
│   ├── 04-Variables-and-Operators
│   ├── 05-String-and-Numbers
│   ├── 06-Lists-and-Dictionaries
│   ├── 07-Conditional-statements-and-loops
│   ├── 08-Functions-Modules-and-Dependencies
│   ├── 09-User-Input-and-File-io
│   ├── 10-Error-handling-and-debugging
│   └── Module-1-Project
├── 2-Data-Structures-And-Regex


```
You can create directories with the `mkdir` command, and create files with the `touch` command.

1. **Add and Commit:** With the new file structure in place, add and commit the changes using `git add` and `git commit` commands.

2. **Push to GitHub:** It's time to push your changes to GitHub. Use the `git push` command to upload your changes to your repository on GitHub.

3. **Verify Your Work:** Check your repository on GitHub. You should see the new file structure in your repository.

By following these steps, you'll have set up a Python project repository on GitHub, with a specific file structure. You will also have committed and pushed your changes to GitHub.
