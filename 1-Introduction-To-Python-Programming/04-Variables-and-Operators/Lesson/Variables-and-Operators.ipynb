    "Comparison operators are used to compare two values. The result of a comparison is a boolean value, either `True` or `False`. We'll learn how to use these operators to make decisions in our code soon, but for now let's just learn what they are and how to use them.\n",

    "| -------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| `==`     | This operator returns `True` if both values are equal. |\n",

    "| `>`      | This operator returns `True` if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. |\n",
    "| `<`      | This operator returns `True` if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. |\n",
    "| `>=`     | This operator returns `True` if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right. |\n",
