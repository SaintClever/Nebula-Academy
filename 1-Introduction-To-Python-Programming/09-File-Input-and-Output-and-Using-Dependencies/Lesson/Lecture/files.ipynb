Python provides various methods and modules to perform file I/O operations. Let's explore some of these concepts:\n","\n","- Opening and closing files using the `open()` function\n","- Reading data from files using methods like `readline()`, `readlines()`, and `read()`\n","- Writing data to files using methods like `write()` and `writelines()`\n","- Utilizing the `with` statement for automatic file closing\n","- Managing file I/O errors using try/except blocks\n","- Accessing the file system and performing OS-related tasks using the `os` module\n","- Reading and writing JSON files using the `json` module\n","- Reading and writing CSV files using the `csv` module\n","\n","Let's dive into each of these concepts one by one."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### üîç Opening and Closing Files\n","\n","To read or write data from a file, you need to open it first.
