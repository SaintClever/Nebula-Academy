    "# Functional Programming and Higher Order Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Functional Programming\n",
    "Welcome to the world of functional programming in Python! This programming paradigm treats computation as evaluating mathematical functions and avoids changing states and mutable data. It's a powerful approach that leads to more predictable and bug-resistant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Functional Programming?\n",
    "- **Predictability:** Pure functions with no side effects mean fewer bugs.\n",
    "- **Modularity:** Easier to break down problems into small functions.\n",
    "- **Ease of Testing:** Pure functions are straightforward to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First-Class Functions in Python\n",
    "Python treats functions as first-class citizens. This means you can:\n",
    "- Assign functions to variables.\n",
    "- Pass functions as arguments to other functions.\n",
    "- Return functions as the results from other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher Order Functions\n",
    "Higher-order functions either take functions as arguments or return them. Examples in Python include `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Map Function\n",
    "`map()` applies a function to each item in an iterable, like a list, and returns a map object (an iterator).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filter Function\n",
    "`filter()` creates an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reduce Function\n",
    "`reduce()` applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "sum_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
    "print(sum_numbers)  # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda Functions\n",
    "Lambda functions in Python are small anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "multiply = lambda x, y: x * y\n",
    "print(multiply(2, 3))  # Output: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Exercises\n",
    "1. **Transforming Data:** Use `map` to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n",
    "2. **Filtering Data:** Use `filter` to extract names starting with a particular letter from a list.\n",
    "3. **Aggregating Data:** Use `reduce` to calculate the total of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Functional programming in Python can make your code more expressive and easier to understand. It's a different way of thinking about your code, but mastering it can significantly enhance the quality of your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Exercises:\n",
    "1. **List Transformation:** Use `map` to create a list of the lengths of each word in the list `[\"Python\", \"Programming\", \"Is\", \"Fun\"]`.\n",
    "2. **Filtering Values:** Use `filter` to get all the prime numbers from a list `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.\n",
    "3. **Data Aggregation:** Use `reduce` to concatenate a list of strings into a single sentence: `[\"Functional\", \"programming\", \"in\", \"Python\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework:\n",
    "1. **Temperature Converter:** Write a program that uses `map` to convert a list of temperatures in Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n",
    "2. **Find Max:** Implement a function using `reduce` to find the maximum number in a list `[5, 7, 2, 4, 9, 1]`.\n",
    "3. **String Processing:** Use `filter` to remove all vowels from a given string."
