Lambda functions are a way of defining small, anonymous functions in Python. They are called “anonymous” because they have no name – instead, they are defined on the fly, right where they are needed. This can make your code more concise and easier to read.

Let’s take a look at an example. Here is a simple function that adds two numbers together:

```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
  return x + y
```
This function works fine, but what if we only need to add two numbers together once, and don’t want to define a whole new function just for that? This is where lambda functions come in. We can define the same function as a lambda function like this:

```python
add_numbers = lambda x, y: x + y
```
This lambda function does the exact same thing as the previous function, but it is defined inline and has no name. We can call it just like we would any other function:

```python
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result) # prints 8
```

Lambda functions can also be used as arguments to other functions. For example, let’s say we have a list of numbers and we want to sort them in descending order. We can use the built-in “sorted” function, which takes in a list and a function to use for sorting. We can define the sorting function as a lambda function like this:

```python
numbers = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: -x)
print(sorted_numbers) # prints [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

In this case, the lambda function takes in a single parameter “x”, which represents each element in the list. The function returns the negative of each element, which causes the list to be sorted in descending order.

## Situations where lambda function could be useful

Sorting a list of dictionaries by a specific key:
```python
people = [{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 20}]
sorted_people = sorted(people, key=lambda x: x['age'])
print(sorted_people)
```

Filtering a list based on a condition:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)
```

Mapping a list to a new list with a function:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)
```

Finding the maximum value in a list:
```python
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
max_number = max(numbers, key=lambda x: x)
print(max_number)
```

Grouping a list of dictionaries by a specific key:
```python
people = [{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 20}]
grouped_people = {}
for person in people:
    age = person['age']
    if age not in grouped_people:
        grouped_people[age] = []
    grouped_people[age].append(person)
print(grouped_people)
```
