# 📊 Library Data Analytics and Visualization Project 📊

## Introduction
Building on your Library Management System, this project integrates basic data analytics, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and web scraping. You will analyze and visualize data from your library system to uncover insights and tell compelling stories.

## 🎯 Objectives 🎯
1. **Web Scraping for Data Enhancement**: Enhance your library's data by scraping relevant information from the web.
2. **Data Analysis with Pandas**: Utilize Pandas to analyze the library data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations of your analysis using MatPlotLib.
4. **Storytelling with Data**: Present your findings in a way that tells a story about your library's usage and trends.

## 👨‍💻 Your Task 👩‍💻
1. **Enhance Library Data**: Use web scraping to gather additional data (like book genres, popularity, etc.) that can complement your library's existing data.
2. **Analyze the Data**: Use Pandas to analyze the data, focusing on trends such as most popular books, demographics of library users, or genre preferences.
3. **Create Visualizations**: Develop 1-3 visualizations that clearly present your findings and insights.
4. **Storytelling**: Use your analysis and visualizations to tell a story. For example, you might discover a trend in genre preference among young adults and suggest increasing the variety of books in that genre to boost library membership.

## 🏁 Submission Guidelines 🏁
Submit a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing your code, visualizations, and a written narrative that explains your findings and the story your data tells.
