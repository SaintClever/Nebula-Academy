In Python, objects are created from a `class`, which is like a blueprint or template for what the object should be like. Think of a class like a cookie cutter – you can use it to make as many cookies as you want, and each cookie will have the same shape and design. Similarly, you can use a class to create as many objects as you want, and each object will have the same set of characteristics.

Here’s an example of a class for creating objects called “Person”:


```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
```

In this class, we have defined two characteristics that every person object will have: a name and an age. The “init” method is a special method that gets called when we create a new object from the class. It takes in two parameters: the name and age of the person we want to create.

Now, let’s use this class to create some person objects:

```python
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
person2 = Person("Bob", 30)
```
Here, we have created two person objects – one named “Alice” who is 25 years old, and another named “Bob” who is 30 years old. Each object has its own unique set of characteristics, but they were both created from the same class.

Now, let’s say we want to add some abilities to our person objects. We can do this by adding methods to our class. Methods are like actions that our objects can perform – for example, a person object might be able to say hello or walk.

Here’s an example of a method we could add to our Person class:

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    
  def say_hello(self):
    print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)
```

This method, called “say_hello”, takes in no parameters and simply prints out a message saying hello and the person’s name. Now, let’s use this method on our person objects:

```python
person1.say_hello() # prints "Hello, my name is Alice"
person2.say_hello() # prints "Hello, my name is Bob"
```

As you can see, each person object can perform the “say_hello” action, but they do it with their own unique name.

In conclusion, Python objects are like magical beings with their own set of characteristics and abilities. They are created from classes, which are like blueprints or templates for what the objects should be like. Each object has its own unique set of characteristics and can perform actions using methods defined in the class. With Python objects, the possibilities are endless – just like the magic of a magician!
