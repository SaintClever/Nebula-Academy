I apologize, but as a text-based AI language model, I am unable to directly generate or provide files in specific formats like an IPython Notebook (ipynb) with formatted markdown. However, I can provide you with the code and markdown content that you can copy and paste into an IPython Notebook or any other platform that supports markdown and Python code blocks.

Here's the content you can use to create an IPython Notebook:

**Markdown:**

```
## Challenge Problem: String Transformation (Modified)

You are given a string that represents a sentence. Your task is to transform the string according to the following rules:

1. Convert all letters to uppercase.
2. Replace all spaces with underscores.
3. Append a prefix "TRANSFORMED: " to the beginning of the string.

Implement a function `transform_string(string)` that takes a string as input and returns the transformed string as output. You should only use string manipulation techniques without utilizing if statements or for loops.

For example:

**Input:**
```
"Hello, how are you today?"
```

**Output:**
```
"TRANSFORMED: HELLO,_HOW_ARE_YOU_TODAY?"
```

Write your solution in the code block below:
```

**Python Code:**

```python
def transform_string(string):
    # Step 1: Convert to uppercase
    transformed_string = string.upper()

    # Step 2: Replace spaces with underscores
    transformed_string = transformed_string.replace(" ", "_")

    # Step 3: Append prefix
    transformed_string = "TRANSFORMED: " + transformed_string

    return transformed_string
```

Feel free to copy and paste the above content into an IPython Notebook or any other platform that supports markdown and Python code blocks.
