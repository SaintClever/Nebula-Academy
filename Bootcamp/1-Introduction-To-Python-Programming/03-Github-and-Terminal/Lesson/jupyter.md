# Introduction to Jupyter and Using the Jupyter Extension in VSCode

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a free, open-source, platform that provides a user-friendly online computing environment for various programming languages, such as Python. Using Jupyter, you can generate and distribute notebooks combining live code, charts, formulas, and explanations.

For those who are studying Python, Jupyter Notebooks are a valuable tool for testing, education, and code documentation. The platform allows you to write and execute code in small, easily accessible cells. You can run each cell individually, which facilitates step-by-step coding and debugging.

## Using Jupyter in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

To use Jupyter in VSCode, you need to install the Jupyter extension. Here's a brief lesson on getting started:

1. **Install the Jupyter extension**: Open VSCode, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for "Jupyter," and click "Install" for the official Jupyter extension.

2. **Create a new notebook**: Click on the Jupyter icon in the sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette and search for "Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook." This will open a new untitled notebook.

3. **Write and execute code**: In the first cell of the notebook, type Python code, such as `print("Hello, world!")`. To execute the code, press Shift+Enter or click the Run Cell button (â–¶) in the cell's top left corner. The output will appear below the cell.

4. **Add more cells**: To add a new cell, click the "+" button in the toolbar or use the shortcut Esc+A (for inserting a cell above) or Esc+B (for inserting a cell below). You can change the cell type to Markdown for text or Code for Python code.

5. **Markdown support**: Jupyter notebooks support Markdown, a simple markup language for formatting text. You can use Markdown cells to write explanations, add headers, create lists, include images, etc. To render the Markdown cell, execute it (Shift+Enter).

6. **Save and share your notebook**: Use the Save button or press Ctrl+S to save your notebook. You can also export it to various formats like HTML or PDF for sharing with others.

It's important to keep in mind that this is only a brief overview of using Jupyter in VSCode. There are numerous additional features and capabilities to delve into, including plot graphing, data analysis, and integration with external libraries. As you continue on your journey of learning Python, Jupyter notebooks will prove to be an essential tool for experimenting, documenting, and presenting your work.
