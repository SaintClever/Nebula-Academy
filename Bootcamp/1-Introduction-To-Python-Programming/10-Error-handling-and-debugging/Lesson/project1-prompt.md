# Project Title: Text-Based RPG in Functional Python

## Objective

Your task is to create a simple, text-based RPG (Role-Playing Game) in Python using a functional programming approach. This game should allow the player to explore different areas and interact meaningfully with non-player characters (NPCs). This game should not involve character creation, a combat system, or any object-oriented programming (OOP) or classes. The goal is to create a simple but immersive gaming experience that is executed entirely through text.

## Requirements

1. **Code Quality:** Your code should be readable and efficient. It should use consistent indentation, self-explanatory variable and function names, and helpful comments where necessary. The game should execute without any unnecessary calculations or loops.

2. **Functional Requirements:**

   - **Exploration:** Create a system for the player to navigate and explore different areas in the game. The navigation system should be intuitive and provide helpful feedback to the player.

   - **Interactions with NPCs:** The game should include non-player characters that the player can interact with. These interactions should be meaningful, affecting gameplay or revealing lore about the game world.

3. **Gameplay Experience:** The game should be challenging but not overly difficult. The progression through the game should feel rewarding and meaningful. Additionally, the text descriptions should be vivid and engaging, fostering a sense of immersion.

## Evaluation

Your game will be evaluated based on the rubric provided. Be sure to review the rubric carefully before submitting your project.
