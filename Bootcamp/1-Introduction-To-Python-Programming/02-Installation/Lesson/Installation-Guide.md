## ‚úÖ Introduction

In this lecture, we will guide you through the installation processes for Python, Git Bash, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and Jupyter Notebook on Windows and macOS operating systems. These tools are essential for developers:

- **Python**: A popular, versatile programming language widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
- **Git Bash (Windows only)**: A Git command-line interface for Windows, which provides a Unix-like shell to interact with Git repositories.
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: A powerful, lightweight, and extensible code editor that supports various programming languages and tools.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive web-based tool for creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

Together, these tools provide a solid foundation for writing, running, and managing code.

## üíæ Installing Python

Python is a popular, versatile programming language that is widely used in various fields, such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning.

**Windows**:
  1. Visit [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest Python installer for Windows.
  2. Run the installer, select "Customize installation," and choose the desired components.
  3. Ensure the "Add Python to PATH" option is checked and click on "Install Now."

**macOS**:
 **Note:** MacOS comes with a pre-installed version of Python, but it's recommended to install the latest version
 1. Visit [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest Python installer for macOS.
 2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
 3. Verify the installation by opening the Terminal and typing `python --version`. You should see the installed Python version.

## üíª Installing Git Bash (Windows only)

Git Bash is a Git command-line interface for Windows, providing a Unix-like shell to interact with Git repositories. It's required on Windows because the default Windows command prompt does not support the Unix-style commands used by Git. This is not necessary for macOS, as macOS includes a Unix-based terminal by default.

1. Download the Git for Windows installer at [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/).
2. Run the installer, accepting the default settings or customizing them as needed.
3. Verify the installation by right-clicking in a folder and selecting "Git Bash Here." A Git Bash terminal window should open.


## üîµ Installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

   VSCode is a powerful, lightweight, and extensible code editor that supports various programming languages and tools.

**Windows**:
  1. Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the Windows installer.
  2. Run the installer, accepting the default settings or customizing them as needed.
  3. Verify the installation by launching VSCode from the Start menu.

**macOS**:
   1. Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the macOS installer.
   2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
   3. Verify the installation by launching VSCode from the Applications folder.


**Installing Code CLI tool**:
  1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
  2. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) to open the command palette.
  3. Type "Shell Command" in the search bar and select "Install 'code' command in PATH."
  4. Once the installation is complete, you can now use the `code` command in your terminal or command prompt to open files and folders in Visual Studio Code.
