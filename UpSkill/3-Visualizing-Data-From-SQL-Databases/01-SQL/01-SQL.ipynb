    "At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the role and importance of SQL in data analysis.\n",
    "2. Understand basic SQL concepts like tables, schemas, keys (primary and foreign), and SQL data types.\n",
    "3. Learn how to use Python's psycopg2 library to interact with SQL databases.\n",
    "4. Set up and connect to a PostgreSQL database in Python.\n",
    "5. Understand SQL syntax for basic operations: CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n",
    "6. Get introduced to the concepts of Joins and data grouping.\n",

    "# What is SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a staple language like JSON and CSV. Instead of storing data SQL provides a way to interact with data. SQL is a language that has been around since the 1970s and is still going strong to this day. It is a language that allows us to interact with databases. SQL is used to create, modify, and query databases. While some databases exist without SQL, most databases use SQL as their language of choice. Something like 79 percent to be exact according to [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2607910/not-so-fast--nosql----sql-still-reigns.html#:~:text=%5B%20The%20best%20open%20source%20software%20of%202022%20%5D&text=While%2079%20percent%20used%20some,with%20some%20form%20of%20NoSQL.).\n",
    "\n",
    "# PostgreSQL and Railway\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source database system. It utilizes SQL to interact with our data. PostgreSQL is a great database to use for this course because it is free and open-source. It is also a very popular database system. It is used by companies like Apple, Spotify, and Netflix. It is also used by the US Department of Defense and the US Department of Energy. PostgreSQL is a great database to learn because it is free, open-source, and widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to utilize a tool called [Railway](https://railway.app/). Railway is a tool that allows us to create and host PostgreSQL databases for free. It also allows us to connect to our database using a GUI (Graphical User Interface). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log into [Railway](https://railway.app/) using your GitHub account.\n",
    "2. Click on the \"New Project\" button.\n",
    "3. Select \"Provision PostgreSQL\".\n",
    "At this point Railway is going to create a database for you in the cloud. It will take a few minutes for Railway to create your database.\n",
    "4. Once your database has been created, you will see what looks like a board with a single card on it. This is your project. It should say \"Postgres\". Click on the project.\n",
    "5. Next click the connect tab. That screen has the information we need to connect to our database.\n",
    "6. Let's add those values to the variables below.\n"

    "# SQL Data Types and Tables\n",

    "Let's start by creating a 'Patients' table. Our table will have fields for 'name', 'age', 'gender', and 'address'. \n",

    "We use CREATE TABLE to create a new table in our database. We follow it with the table name and then a list of fields. Each field has a name and a data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the data types for each field. We will use these data types to tell SQL what kind of data to expect in each field. We will use SERIAL, TEXT, and INTEGER datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type | Description |\n",
    "| --------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| `SERIAL` | The `SERIAL` data type is an auto-incrementing integer. It's typically used for primary keys in PostgreSQL. When you insert a new row into the table without specifying the value of the SERIAL column, PostgreSQL will automatically generate a new value for you. The value starts from 1, and it's incremented by 1 for each new row. |\n",
    "| `TEXT` | The `TEXT` data type is used to store character of unlimited length. It's suitable for storing long-form text, comments, document content, etc. Unlike `VARCHAR(n)`, it does not require you to define a length at the table creation stage. |\n",
    "| `INTEGER` | The `INTEGER` data type is used to store whole numbers, without a fractional component. In PostgreSQL, it has a range of -2147483648 to +2147483647. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that these are general descriptions, and the specific behavior can vary slightly based on the SQL database system you are using. (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the PRIMARY KEY constraint to uniquely identify each row in the table. In this case, we are using the 'id' field as our primary key. We will use this field to uniquely identify each patient in our table.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "\n",

    "Last thing to note is the cursor methods we are going to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Description |\n",
    "| ------ | ----------- |\n",
    "| `execute()` | This method is used to execute a SQL query. It takes a single string as an argument. The string should be a valid SQL query. Also note we use \"\"\" to create a multi-line string. This is a Python feature. It allows us to create a string that spans multiple lines. |\n",
