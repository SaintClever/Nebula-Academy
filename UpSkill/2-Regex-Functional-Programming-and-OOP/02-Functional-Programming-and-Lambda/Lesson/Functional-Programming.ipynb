          "Alright, squad! Let's get our coding game on! 🎮 We're about to dive into the world of functional programming, a paradigm that views computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Yep, it's like going back to your algebra classes, but with a cool, coding twist! 🌀\n",
          "\n",
          "In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens. That means functions can be assigned to variables, stored in collections, or passed as arguments. This concept can be a powerful tool for creating modular and readable code. 🚀 So, even though functional programming might sound academic and theoretical, it's actually super practical and will level up your coding skills like no other! 🔥\n",

          "Let's contrast this with other popular programming paradigms:\n",
          "- **Imperative programming**: Here, code is organized around actions or commands. Think of it as a step-by-step recipe to achieve your program's goal. 🧑‍🍳\n",
          "- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**: Code is organized around objects and data rather than actions and logic. It's all about creating objects, manipulating these objects, and making them work together to create robust and flexible software. 🏗️\n",

          "Now that we've covered the basics of functional programming, it's time to put that theory into practice. 🏋️‍♀️ For this exercise, I want you to write a Python function in both a traditional style and a functional style. The function should take in a list of numbers and return a new list with each number doubled. For the traditional style, feel free to use a loop. For the functional style, try using Python's built-in `map` function. Remember, coding is like cooking -- everyone has their own flavor. Let's see yours! 🍲"
