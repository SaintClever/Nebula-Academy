    "# Mastering Object-Oriented Programming in Python 😎🐍\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming 🌟\n",
    "Python is a versatile programming language that supports multiple paradigms, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming. OOP organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes, whereas Functional Programming revolves around functions. 🐍🔧\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles of OOP:\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Keeping fields (variables) and methods (functions) wrapped in a class. 📦🔒\n",
    "2. Inheritance: One class acquiring properties and methods from another class. 🔄📚\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Functions or operators behaving differently based on operand types. 🎭🔁\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes and Objects 🏗️🌟\n",
    "In Python, a class is like a blueprint for creating objects with associated behaviors and attributes. You create an object by instantiating a class using the class's constructor. 🏗️🌌\n"
