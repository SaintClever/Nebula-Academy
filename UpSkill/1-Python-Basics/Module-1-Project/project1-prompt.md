## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create an engaging text-based RPG game. The game should offer a dynamic and immersive experience for the players, allowing them to make choices that impact the game's progress. 

## Requirements:

### General Requirements:

1. The game should have a minimum of three major locations that the player can navigate. Each location should offer unique interactions and experiences.

2. The game should be flexible and scalable, with organized and modular code. This will allow for easier expansion and modification in the future.

3. The player should have the ability to customize certain aspects of the game. This could be naming a character or an object, choosing a path, or making decisions that affect the game's outcome.

### Functional Requirements:

1. Each location should have unique interactions that the player can perform, such as using an object, interacting with a character, or leaving the location.

2. The game should allow for navigation between these locations. 

3. There should be outcomes for each interaction that impact the game's progress. For example, acquiring an item could open up new interactions, or making a certain choice could alter the game's story.

## Gameplay Experience:

1. The game should be engaging and immersive, with a balance of challenge and reward.

2. It should provide a sense of progression and achievement as players navigate through it.

3. Players should have the freedom to make their own choices and explore different outcomes, adding to the replayability of the game.

4. The game should incorporate surprises or unexpected outcomes to keep the gameplay exciting and unpredictable.

## Evaluation:

Your game will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Fulfillment of the functional requirements: Does your game meet all the specified functional requirements?

2. Gameplay experience: Is your game engaging, immersive, and fun to play? Does it offer replayability and a good balance of challenge and reward?

3. Code organization and modularity: Is your code well-structured, organized, and modular? Can it be easily expanded or modified?

4. Creativity and innovation: How creative and original is your game? Have you included any unique features or mechanics that enhance the gameplay experience?

Remember, the purpose of this project is not just to meet the requirements but to create something fun and engaging. Don't be afraid to think outside the box and push the boundaries of what a text-based RPG game can be. Good luck!
