    "# Lecture: Introduction to Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our lecture on Matplotlib, a powerful library in Python used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. This session is designed for beginners who are new to Matplotlib. By the end of this lecture, you will have a fundamental understanding of creating and customizing basic plots using Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the significance of data visualization and the role of Matplotlib.\n",
    "- Learn to create basic plots using Matplotlib.\n",
    "- Explore customization options for enhancing the visual appeal and clarity of plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Why Matplotlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Importance of Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Communication**: Effective way to communicate complex data and insights.\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Aids in data exploration and identifying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.\n",
    "- It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Getting Started with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Figure**: The entire figure or canvas.\n",
    "- **Axes**: A part of the figure where data is plotted, like a graph.\n",
    "- **Axis**: Number-line-like objects that define the graph limits.\n",
    "- **Artist**: Everything visible on the figure (e.g., Text, Line2D, collections).\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Plot Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "y = [10, 20, 25, 30]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure and an axes\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot data\n",
    "ax.plot(x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Types of Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Plot Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Line Plot**: For showing trends over time.\n",
    "- **Bar Chart**: Useful for comparing quantities across categories.\n",
    "- **Histogram**: Ideal for showing frequency distributions.\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot**: Great for showing the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Different Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Line plot\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bar chart\n",
    "plt.bar(x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Histogram\n",
    "plt.hist(y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scatter plot\n",
    "plt.scatter(x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4: Customizing Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plot Customizations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding Titles and Labels**: Enhance understanding of the plot.\n",
    "- **Colors and Styles**: Make your plot attractive and distinguish different data sets.\n",
    "- **Markers and Line Styles**: Highlight specific points or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y, color='green', linestyle='dashed', marker='o',\n",
    "         markerfacecolor='blue', markersize=12)\n",
    "plt.xlabel('X-axis Label')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Y-axis Label')\n",
    "plt.title('Customized Line Plot')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task**: Create a multi-plot figure showing different data visualizations (line plot, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot).\n",
    "- **Dataset**: Use any dataset of interest, like a CSV sales data file or stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, you've learned the basics of Matplotlib and how to create a variety of plots. Data visualization is a crucial skill in data analysis, and mastering Matplotlib will significantly enhance your ability to communicate data insights effectively. Keep practicing with different datasets and explore the vast customization options Matplotlib offers to become proficient in data visualization.\n",
