# üìä Visualizing JSON Data with Matplotlib

## Part 1: Loading JSON Data üìÅ

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

### Loading JSON into Pandas

First, explain the basics of JSON and its common usage in data exchange. Then show how to load JSON data directly into a DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

# Assuming the JSON data is stored in a file named 'student_data.json'
with open('student_data.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

# Convert JSON to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.head())
```

### Sample JSON Data: `student_data.json`

Create a fictional JSON file `student_data.json` with data about student activities and the number of hours spent on each activity per week.

```json
[
  { "Student": "Alice", "Study": 35, "Sports": 5, "Leisure": 15, "Sleep": 60 },
  { "Student": "Bob", "Study": 20, "Sports": 10, "Leisure": 30, "Sleep": 60 },
  { "Student": "Chloe", "Study": 40, "Sports": 3, "Leisure": 10, "Sleep": 57 },
  { "Student": "David", "Study": 15, "Sports": 20, "Leisure": 40, "Sleep": 50 },
  { "Student": "Emma", "Study": 30, "Sports": 6, "Leisure": 20, "Sleep": 55 }
]
```

## Part 2: Introduction to Histograms üìä

Histograms are used to represent the distribution of a dataset by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.

### Why Histograms?

- Effective for showing the shape of the distribution of data points.
- Useful in detecting patterns, outliers, skewness, etc.

### Creating a Histogram

Demonstrate how to visualize the distribution of study hours among students.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extracting study hours
study_hours = df['Study']

# Creating the histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(study_hours, bins=5, color='blue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Study Hours')
plt.xlabel('Study Hours per Week')
plt.ylabel('Number of Students')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Part 3: Customizing Histograms üé®

Explain the customization options for histograms, such as bin size, color, and more.

### Adjusting Bin Size

```python
plt.hist(study_hours, bins=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50], color='green', edgecolor='black')  # Specify exact bin edges
plt.title('Histogram with Custom Bins')
plt.xlabel('Study Hours per Week')
plt.ylabel('Number of Students')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion üèÅ

Wrap up by discussing how histograms help in understanding the distribution characteristics of a dataset. Encourage the students to experiment with different data and visualization types.

### Q&A

Provide time for students to ask questions about the material covered, including specific visualization techniques or JSON data handling.
