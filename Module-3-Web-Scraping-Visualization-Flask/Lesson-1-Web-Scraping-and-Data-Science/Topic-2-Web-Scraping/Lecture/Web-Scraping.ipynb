    "# Detailed Lecture on Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to an in-depth session on web scraping using Beautiful Soup! This lecture is designed for beginners with little to no prior knowledge of web scraping. By the end of this session, you will be equipped with the foundational skills to perform basic scraping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the structure of HTML and its relevance to web scraping.\n",
    "- Learn the fundamentals of the Beautiful Soup library.\n",
    "- Prepare for a practice assignment using Beautiful Soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Understanding HTML for Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is HTML?\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTML is the building block of all web pages. It structures the web content as a tree with nested tags and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic HTML Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`<html>`**: Root of the HTML document.\n",
    "- **`<head>`**: Contains metadata and script links.\n",
    "- **`<body>`**: Where the visible page content lives.\n",
    "- **`<h1>`, `<h2>`, ..., `<h6>`**: Heading tags.\n",
    "- **`<p>`**: Paragraph tag.\n",
    "- **`<a>`**: Hyperlinks.\n",
    "- **`<div>`**, **`<span>`**: Generic containers for content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`class`**: Classifies elements for CSS styling.\n",
    "- **`id`**: Unique identifier for an element.\n",
    "- **`href`**: URL in a link tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Introduction to Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install beautifulsoup4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Concepts of Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parsing HTML**: Convert a string of HTML into a Beautiful Soup object.\n",
    "- **Navigating the Parse Tree**: Traversing nested HTML tags.\n",
    "- **Searching by Tags and Attributes**: Locating elements by tag names and their attributes.\n",
    "- **Extracting Data**: Getting text or attributes from HTML elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Soup Object\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "url = 'https://example.com'\n",
    "response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "html_content = response.content\n",
    "\n",
    "soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`requests.get(url)`**: Fetches the HTML content of the page.\n",
    "- **`BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')`**: Parses the HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Extracting Data with Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`find()`**: Finds the first occurrence of a tag.\n",
    "- **`find_all()`**: Finds all occurrences of a tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find the first paragraph\n",
    "first_paragraph = soup.find('p')\n",
    "print(first_paragraph.text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find all hyperlinks\n",
    "all_links = soup.find_all('a')\n",
    "for link in all_links:\n",
    "    print(link.get('href'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Searching by Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find elements with a specific class\n",
    "elements = soup.find_all('div', class_='class-name')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating the Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traverse down: Using `.contents` or `.children`.\n",
    "- Traverse up: Using `.parent`.\n",
    "- Traverse sideways: Using `.next_sibling` or `.previous_sibling`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4: Using Browser Developer Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Developer Tools in your browser (usually F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect).\n",
    "- Use the Elements tab to inspect the HTML structure.\n",
    "- The Network tab helps observe HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task**: Scrape a news website to extract headline texts and URLs.\n",
    "- **Steps**:\n",
    "    1. Identify the URL of the news website.\n",
    "    2. Inspect the page using Developer Tools to find the HTML structure of headlines.\n",
    "    3. Write a Python script using Beautiful Soup to extract and print headlines and their URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture has introduced you to the basics of HTML and the fundamentals of using Beautiful Soup for web scraping. With these skills, you're now prepared to undertake the practice assignment and start your journey into the world of data scraping. Remember, practice is critical to mastering web scraping, so dive in and explore the vast data available on the web!"
