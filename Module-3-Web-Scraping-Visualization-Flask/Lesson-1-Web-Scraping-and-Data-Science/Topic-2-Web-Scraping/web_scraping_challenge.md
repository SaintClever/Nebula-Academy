##  Project: Scrape and Analyze Website Data ðŸš€

### Objective

Your objective is to scrape data from a website that's accessible with Beautiful Soup (ensure the website allows scraping by reviewing its robots.txt file) and to analyze this data using Pandas.

### Steps

1. Choose a website to scrape. For beginners, a simple website with a clear structure is recommended (e.g., http://books.toscrape.com).
2. Use Beautiful Soup to extract relevant data from the site, such as product names, prices, or any data of interest.
3. Store the extracted data in a Pandas DataFrame.
4. Perform basic data analysisâ€”calculate averages, find the most expensive items, or visualize the data using Pandas' plotting capabilities.

### Try It Yourself

- **Scraping Part**: Write a script to scrape data from your chosen website. Focus on extracting at least two related pieces of information (e.g., book names and prices).
- **Analysis Part**: Load your scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame and perform at least two analyses or visualizations.

### Tips

- Respect the website's `robots.txt` policy to ensure ethical scraping.
- Check the websiteâ€™s terms of service before scraping.
- Test your scraping code incrementally to avoid overwhelming the website's server.

Happy scraping, and enjoy the insights you'll uncover with your analysis!
