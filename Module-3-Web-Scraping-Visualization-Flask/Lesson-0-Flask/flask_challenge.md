# Flask Basics Assignment

## Overview

In this in-class assignment, you'll apply the Flask concepts discussed in the lecture to create a simple Flask application. This activity is designed to solidify your understanding through practical application, while also providing an opportunity for peer and instructor feedback during the review process.

## Objectives

- Set up a Flask development environment.
- Develop a minimal Flask application that demonstrates routing and response handling.
- Enhance your understanding of Flask by creating routes that return text and JSON responses.

## Assignment Details

You are tasked with creating a Flask application that includes the following features:

1. **Homepage Route**: A route (`/`) that returns a welcoming message, such as "Welcome to Flask Basics!".
2. **JSON Response Route**: A route (`/api/greet`) designed to handle GET requests and return a JSON response with a greeting message: `{"message": "Hello, World!"}`.
3. **Dynamic Greeting Route (Optional Challenge)**: Implement a dynamic route (`/api/greet/<name>`) that accepts a user's name as a parameter and returns a personalized JSON greeting: `{"message": "Hello, <name>!"}`.

## Classroom Review Expectations

During the in-class review, we'll go over each participant's application. Here's what we'll look out for:

- **Functionality**: Each route should operate as expected, handling requests and returning the correct types of responses.
- **Code Organization**: The application code should be logically structured, with clear separation between routes and clean, readable code.
- **Innovation and Creativity**: While the assignment outlines specific routes, creative implementations or additions are encouraged. The optional challenge is a starting point, but feel free to explore beyond!
- **Discussion and Feedback**: Be prepared to discuss your approach and any challenges you faced. This is a learning opportunity to both receive and provide constructive feedback.

## Note

This is a collaborative and educational exercise intended to foster a deeper understanding of Flask and web development principles. There are no "right" or "wrong" submissions, as long as the requirements are met and you can explain your thought process. The focus is on learning and improvement.
