### **Python Course Capstone Project Prompt: Beginner-Friendly EDA for Global Challenges**

#### **Project Overview:**
As a critical part of your Python learning journey, you are about to embark on a capstone project that combines your newfound Python skills with exploring real-world issues. Your task is to conduct a fundamental Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) related to one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This project is designed for beginners, focusing on simple yet effective EDA techniques to uncover insights from data.

#### **Objectives:**
1. **SDG Selection:** Choose a UN SDG and a specific, related challenge to focus your analysis.
2. **Basic Python EDA:** Employ Python to conduct a fundamental EDA. You will:
   - Load and inspect data using Python libraries.
   - Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
   - Perform simple statistical analysis and data visualization.
3. **SDG Insight Discovery:** Use your EDA to uncover basic insights about your chosen SDG challenge.
4. **Project Documentation:** Document your EDA process and findings, emphasizing clarity and simplicity.
5. **Presentation:** Present your EDA, explaining your process, findings, and how they relate to the chosen SDG.

#### **Suggested Beginner-Friendly EDA Projects:**
- **Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being):** Analyze a dataset on health indicators to identify disease-related patterns.
- **Goal 4 (Quality Education):** Explore education-related data to understand literacy or school enrollment trends.
- **Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities):** Investigate urban data to find insights into housing or transportation.
- **Goal 13 (Climate Action):** Analyze climate data to observe trends in temperature changes or pollution levels.
- **Goal 15 (Life on Land):** Study wildlife data to identify patterns in species population or habitat changes.

Your EDA project will apply the Python basics you've learned, including data types, control structures, and simple data handling techniques. This project is a stepping stone in your Python journey, preparing you for more complex data analysis in the future. Dive in, explore, and discover the power of data with Python!
