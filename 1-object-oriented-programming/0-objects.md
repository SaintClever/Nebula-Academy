In programming everythining has to come down to a singular building block. In python and all other `Object-Oriented Programming` languages that is the `Object` class.


An object is a container for variables. Objects have keys which map to a value.

```python
car = {"topSpeed": 30, "wheels": 4}
print(car)
```

Just like any other variable the values can be read and updated as freely as you want

```python
car["topSpeed"] = 50
print(car)
```

You can assign new key value pairs to an object

```python
car["currentSpeed"] = 0
print(car)
```
